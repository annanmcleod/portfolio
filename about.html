        Hey, I'm Anna McLeod! I am a current student attending Base Camp Coding Academy in Water Valley, Mississippi. I am looking to gain a career in software development. I currently reside in New Albany, Mississippi and have been commuting back and forth. From a young age I have always been passionate about art design and graphics. What made me want to pursue software development is the opportunity to create anything with little to no limit. What I can develop I hope can be of use to others and inspire.
